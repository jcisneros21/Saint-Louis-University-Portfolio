###Style
* Very readable. Nice comments, too. Using `goto` is sometimes frowned upon, but not in the Linux kernel, and that's good enough for me. At least you chose to use it in exactly the sort of place it should be used.

###Compiliation
* No errors, no warnings

###Operation
* Single commands work well.
* Too many arguments handled well, no crash.
* Failed exec reported well.
* cd command working.
* piped commands working well.
* bad pipe syntax handled well - error reported
* signal handling working

Very nice work!
