6 minutes.  OK.

###Style
Consistent indentation. Helpful comments.

###Compiliation
No errors, no warnings

###Operation
* Basic `malloc()` operation working well.
* Cutting blocks into pieces works.
* Freeing a block does allow for smaller blocks to come out of it, however malloc is not re-using freed blocks when the new request is the same size as the freed block. **[-3]**
* Nice job with `calloc()`.
* Nice job with `realloc()`.
* `malloc()` crashes on out-of-memory. **[-3]**
